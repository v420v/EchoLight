# Commit Message Guidelines

# Use one of the following prefixes for your commit messages:
# feat:     A new feature
# fix:      A bug fix
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)

# Example Commit Messages:
# feat: add new dark mode option to Echo theme
# fix: correct typo in theme description
# refactor: improve color contrast for better readability
# style: update formatting in echo-color-theme.json

# Please provide a detailed description of the changes in the commit body.
# If the commit addresses an issue, include the issue number in the commit message.
# For example: "fix: resolve issue with theme color not applying (#42)"

# Commit messages should be in the present tense.
# Example: "fix: resolve issue with theme color not applying"
# Not: "fixed: resolved issue with theme color not applying"
